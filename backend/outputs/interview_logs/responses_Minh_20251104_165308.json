            "response": "Good morning, and thank you for having me. I’m Lê Minh Tuấn, currently pursuing a degree in Information Technology with a focus on Data Transformation at the National Economics University. My academic journey has been shaped by a strong interest in how data can drive smarter decisions and create better user experiences.\n\nProfessionally, I’ve had the opportunity to work on several projects involving data engineering and backend development, where I built pipelines to process and transform large datasets efficiently. Over time, I became increasingly interested in how this data is presented to users — which led me to explore frontend development more deeply.\n\nI’ve since worked on full-stack applications, contributing to both the backend logic and the frontend interfaces. This dual perspective has helped me build more cohesive, user-friendly systems. I’m especially passionate about creating intuitive, accessible, and performant web applications that bridge the gap between complex data and real-world usability.\n\nNow, I’m excited to take on a leadership role where I can mentor others, drive technical excellence, and help shape the frontend architecture of impactful products.\n\nWould you like me to tailor this further for a specific company or role?"
