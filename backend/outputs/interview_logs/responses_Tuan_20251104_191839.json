            "question": "Your CV mentions you're comfortable working in team environments and committed to collaborative learning. Can you describe a time when you collaborated on a project (academic or work) that faced unexpected challenges or disagreements within the team? How did you contribute to resolving the situation?",
            "response": "During a university group project on digital marketing strategy, our team faced a disagreement over the target audience and campaign direction.

            "question": "As a Product Manager, you'll often need to understand user behavior and product performance through data. Given your experience with SQL and data extraction, how would you go about getting data to understand how users interact with a specific feature in a new travel application (e.g., a 'save to wishlist' button)? What kind of data points would you look for?",
            "response": "To understand how users interact with the ‘save to wishlist’ feature, I’d start by writing SQL queries to extract relevant event data from our analytics or tracking database.\n\n🔍 Steps to get the data:\nQuery the event logs or user actions table where interactions with the wishlist button are recorded.\n\nFilter by event type (e.g., wishlist_save) and timestamp to analyze trends over time.\n\nJoin with user profiles or session data to segment by user type, device, or location.\n\n📊 Key data points to look for:\nTotal number of saves: How often the button is used.\n\nUnique users saving items: Adoption rate across the user base.\n\nSave frequency per user: Engagement depth.\n\nConversion rate: How many saved items lead to bookings.\n\nDrop-off rate: Users who save but don’t return.\n\nTime between save and booking: Decision-making behavior.\n\nDevice and platform breakdown: Mobile vs desktop usage.\n\n💡 Takeaway:\nThis helps identify whether the feature drives meaningful engagement or needs UX improvements.

            "question": "You have experience with ETL workflows and 'creating data pipelines to collect, clean, and transform raw data.' From a Product Manager's perspective, why is data quality and the integrity of an ETL pipeline critical for making informed product decisions, even if you're not building the pipeline yourself?",
            "response": "As a Product Manager, I rely heavily on data to understand user behavior, measure feature performance, and guide strategic decisions. If the ETL pipeline is flawed — for example, missing events, duplicate records, or inconsistent formatting — it can lead to misleading insights and poor decisions.\n\nEven if I’m not building the pipeline myself, I need to ensure:\n\nData accuracy: So metrics like conversion rate or retention are trustworthy.\n\nTimeliness: So I can respond quickly to user trends or issues.\n\nConsistency: So dashboards and reports align across teams.\n\nUltimately, clean and reliable data builds confidence in product decisions and helps avoid costly missteps. That’s why I always collaborate closely with data engineers and analysts to validate what we’re seeing before acting on it."

What was the most significant challenge you faced there, and what did you learn from it that you think could apply to a Product Management role?",
            "response": "At FSS – Financial Software Solutions, I worked with the data team to support ETL workflows that collected, cleaned, and transformed raw financial transaction data into structured formats for reporting. My role involved writing SQL queries to extract data, validating data integrity, and helping build automated pipelines that fed dashboards used by internal stakeholders.\n\n🔧 Key contributions:\nCreated reusable SQL scripts for extracting KPIs like transaction volume and error rates.\n\nHelped design a pipeline that reduced manual reporting time by 40%.\n\nCollaborated with analysts to ensure the data matched business logic and reporting needs.\n\n⚠️ Biggest challenge:\nOne major challenge was dealing with inconsistent data formats across multiple sources, which caused reporting discrepancies. I worked with engineers to implement validation checks and standardization rules early in the pipeline.\n\n💡 What I learned for Product Management:\nData quality is critical — flawed data leads to flawed decisions.\n\nCross-functional collaboration is key — aligning engineers, analysts, and business teams ensures the product delivers reliable insights.\n\nEmpathy for technical constraints helps PMs set realistic goals and timelines."
